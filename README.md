- [ ] JSON scene description format

## Showcase

| ~00:00:08 - 10 samples per pixel |

| ![](screenshots/cornell-oren-nayar-10spp-denoised.png) |
|:--:| 
| ~00:00:16 - 10 samples per pixel, denoised, no aux buffers | 

## TODOs
- .gltf2 scene support?
    - config.json
        - frames to render
        - samples per ray
        - denoising or not
        - windows size
        - scene background color
    - scene to load?
    - BRDFs on which model (mapping)?
- Explicit light sampling / next event estimation / shadow rays
    - Split direct + indirect
- Diffuse & Specular BRDF support on materials?
    - Subsurface scattering BRDF support?
    - Model volume support
- Russian roulette termination (min bounds?)
