| ![](screenshots/cornell-oren-nayar-2000spp-456s.png) |
|:--:| 
| 00:07:36 - 2000 samples per pixel |

Rusteray, a physically based path tracer written in Rust.

## Features
- [X] BRDF support: Lambertian, Oren-Nayar 
- [X] Multithreaded with a threadpool
- [X] Denoising support via [Intel OpenImageDenoise](https://github.com/OpenImageDenoise/oidn)
- [X] JSON config 
- [X] gltf2 model support

## Showcase

|:--:| 
| ~00:00:08 - 10 samples per pixel |

| ![](screenshots/cornell-oren-nayar-10spp-denoised.png) |
|:--:| 
| ~00:00:16 - 10 samples per pixel, denoised, no aux buffers | 

## TODOs
- .gltf2 scene support?
    - config.json
        - frames to render
        - samples per ray
        - denoising or not
        - windows size
        - scene background color
          - scene background color gradient?
          - scene background atmosphere modeling?
    - scene to load?
    - BRDFs on which model (mapping)?
- Explicit light sampling / next event estimation 
- Diffuse & Specular BRDF support on materials?
    - Unify BSDF = BRDF + BTDF?
    - Bi-directional Transmission Distribution Function support (BTDF)?
    - Subsurface scattering BRDF support?
    - Model volume support
- Russian roulette termination (min bounds?)
